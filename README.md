# Hand Gesture Mouse Controller

This project is a simple implementation of hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and PyAutoGUI. With this program, you can control your mouse pointer and perform click and right-click actions with your hand gestures.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you need to have the following packages installed:
- OpenCV
- numpy
- PyAutoGUI
- cvzone

You can install the required packages using pip:

```pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui cvzone```

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```python hand_gesture_mouse_controller.py```


The program will start running and you should see your camera output on the screen. You can control your mouse pointer by using the following hand gestures:

- **Index, middle, and ring fingers up:** Move the mouse pointer
- **Index finger up, others down:** Left-click
- **Index and middle fingers up, ring finger down:** Right-click
- **Index and middle fingers up, ring finger partially up:** Drag and drop
